Several years ago, I created [Meetup Photo Download(MPDL)](https://github.com/krcourville/meetup-photo-download) as an experiment in learning how to consume HTTP REST services.  Now, the functionality of MPDL has re-vamped and re-created as a commercial application.  If this is all you need to know, please navigate to the product landing page now:

# What does this mean for you?

I am aware of the issues found in MPDL but do not time to contribute to it further without some sort of motivation.  Since, some users of MPDL have expressed the desire to contribute payment as a result of the time saved.  Now, you can contribute to further development by purchasing your own license of [Easy Photo Downloader](https://easydownload.photos) through the Microsoft Store.

As an owner of [Easy Photo Downloader](https://easydownload.photos), any bug report you file will be taken seriously and addressed immediately.
