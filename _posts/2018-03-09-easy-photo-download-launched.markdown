Several years ago, I created [Meetup Photo Download(MPDL)](https://github.com/krcourville/meetup-photo-download) as an experiment in learning how to consume HTTP REST services.  Now, the functionality of MPDL has re-vamped and re-created as a commercial application.  If this is all you need to know, please navigate to the product landing page now:

# What does this mean for you?

I am aware issues found in the MPDL app but do not time to contribute to it further without some sort of motiviation.  Users have expressed the desire to contribute payment as a result of the time saved by using MPDL.  Now, you can do so by purchasing your own license of [Easy Photo Downloader](https://easydownload.photos) through the Microsoft Store.
