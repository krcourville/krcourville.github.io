Below are a few resources I consult on a regular basis to learn about new techniques and evolving technologies.  There's many I'm forgetting, so I'll keep adding to this list over time.

## Training

* [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io): Training in short video format.  Sign up for the mailing list and you'll often been alerted for free courses on new tech
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/): Interactive learning online.  Some courses are free or sponsored.  Others require a monthly subscription.
* [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/training): Training videos on many topics: programming, sys admin, business, architecting, creative.. 

## Newsletters

Email is making a comeback. I skim this newsletters regularly for topics of interest.

* [Hacker Newsletter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/): Weekly aggregate of news related to programming and technology.
* [Vue-Newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/vuenewsletter)
* [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com)
* [FrontEnd Focus](http://frontendfocus.co)

* [Mobile Web Weekly](https://mobilewebweekly.com)

## Medium

Just try it.  Pick topics you want to learn about and go!

## Blogs

I don't look at blogs so much these days, but I can't remove Scott H from my list

* [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/): I learned TONS from this dude.  Be sure to check out his [Ultimate Developer and Power Tools list](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2014UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx).
