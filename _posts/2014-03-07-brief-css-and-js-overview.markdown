In a recent knowledge sharing session with co-workers, I was tasked with explaining what CSS can do for you.  Based on the context of the question, which involved, SAP CRM UI improvments integration, I was having a hard time thinking of a way to talk about CSS without also covering some HTML and JavaScript. As a result, I put together little tutorial on Github here:

Maybe this tutorial can help others out, who might have a vague curiousity about web applications.  Check it out.
