I run across lots of people who could save a little time and RSI by not reaching for the mouse quite as much.

Here are some shortcuts I use most often. These shortcuts work in IE, Firefox, and Chrome as well as some other Windows applications.

* `<Tab>` Move to next field
* `<Shift> + <Tab>` Move to previous field
* `<Alt> + <D>` Place focus in web browser address area
	* Combine with `<Ctrl> + <C>` to quickly copy the current web address to the clipboard
	* Combine with [typing text] then `<Ctrl> + <Enter>` to quickly enter and browse to an address like www.sometext.com
* `<Ctrl> + <T>` Open a new browser tab
* `<Ctrl> + <N>` Open a new browser window
* `<Ctrl> + <F4>` Close a tab
* `<Ctrl> + <Tab>` Change to the next tab
* `<Ctrl> + <Shift> + <Tab>` Change to the previous tab
* `<F5>` Refresh the current web page
* `<Ctrl> + <F5>` Same as F5 but also forces all page content to be download from the server (no cache).  Very useful for resolving web page issues.
* `<Shift> + <Left Click>` (on a link): Open the link in a new window
* `<Ctrl> + <Left Click>` (on a link): Open the link in a new tab
